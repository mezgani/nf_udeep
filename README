Kernel insertion notes:

If you need to add a driver to kernel source tree. You have to modified first 
the Kconfig and the menu items are being shown in make menuconfig.
and check after that your .config contains the following entry 
CONFIG_UDEEP=y

and Makefile:

M_OBJS := udeep.o
obj-$(CONFIG_UDEEP) += udeep.o
export-objs := udeep.o
include $(TOPDIR)/Rules.make


Well, if you put your driver code in a new directory,  you might
have to add the following line to the Makefile one level above your
directory: 

subdir-$(CONFIG_MYUSB) += udeep
